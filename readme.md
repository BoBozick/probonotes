# Probonotes

Probonotes is a Typst styling package for
mathematical notes with theorem environments and mathematical notation.

Note that this package is not intended for public use
and may therefore be impractical for such.
It is not published to the offical repository but can easily be
[installed locally](https://github.com/typst/packages?tab=readme-ov-file#local-packages).

For example usages, see my notes that I have uploaded to
[my GitHub](https://github.com/BoBozick).
I recommend reading the source code for a fuller understanding.
In short, `lib.typ` is the main file that
imports all functionality from the other `.typ` files.

English is fully supported, while Swedish is partially supported.

The name is a [double entendre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre)
of _pro bono publico_, for the public good,
and _pro Bo's notes_, for my notes.
